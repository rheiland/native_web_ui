# native_web_ui

Undergraduate student-led project to explore what's possible with native Web user intefaces. We are curious if this might be a replacement for the PyQt5-based PhysiCell Studio desktop application. But besides that, it seems like worthwhile knowledge and skils for students to have.

Two of the more popular native Web UI frameworks with a Python API are https://streamlit.io/ vs. https://www.gradio.app/ .

## Goals
* what are some example applications where these UIs are used?
* how do these two frameworks differ (at a high level)?
* demonstrate some very simple UIs, starting with Streamlit.

## Questions (related to PhysiCell Studio)
* what interactive plotting packages are possible to use within Streamlit (or Gradio)?
